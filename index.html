    `Dear ${company},

Words. They‚Äôre not just my tools ‚Äî they‚Äôre my battleground.

Whether it‚Äôs a three-word headline or a manifesto that makes planners cry, I bring emotion, edge, and just the right amount of alliteration.

Hire me, and let‚Äôs turn your brand story into an epic worth binge-reading.

Yours in Oxford commas,  
${name}`
  ],

  strategist: [
    `To the fine minds at ${company},

Ever since I first uttered the words ‚Äúconsumer insight,‚Äù I knew I was born for this.

If you're looking for someone who can connect cultural trends to campaign KPIs faster than a Gen Z on TikTok, I'm your person.

Let's architect the strategy that Cannes case studies are made of.

Always aligning,  
${name}`
  ],

  designer: [
    `Hey ${company},

Design isn't decoration. It‚Äôs storytelling with pixels, gridlines, and just enough white space to breathe.

From brutalist banners to brand guidelines tighter than kerning on a Helvetica R, I build with feeling and finesse.

Aesthetic allegiance,  
${name}`
  ],

  creative_director: [
    `Dear ${company},

I don't direct creatives. I conduct symphonies of chaos into campaigns that convert.

Give me your briefs, your budgets, your jaded clients yearning to believe again ‚Äî and I‚Äôll give you the best work of their fiscal year.

In relentless pursuit of big ideas,  
${name}`,

    `To the team at ${company},

I've turned brainstorms into battles, post-its into poetry, and edits into Emmy bait.

If your agency wants iconic, not just effective ‚Äî I‚Äôm ready to make award season cry.

Humbly legendary,  
${name}`,

    `Dear ${company},

Every campaign starts with a whisper. I turn that whisper into a roar.

From Cannes to client decks, I speak fluent chaos and vision. Let me help your agency forget what safe ever looked like.

Signed with ambition,  
${name}`,

    `Hello ${company},

Vision. Volume. Vibes. That‚Äôs what I bring to a pitch, a room, and a Slack thread.

I‚Äôve led global teams with three hours of sleep and one killer idea. Let‚Äôs create the kind of work the industry worships and interns quote in pitch decks.

Loudly leading,  
${name}`,

    `Dear ${company},

You don‚Äôt just need a creative director. You need a dream disruptor with pitch decks that make clients weep (with joy).

Let‚Äôs take your agency‚Äôs name from memorable‚Ä¶ to mythological.

Respectfully iconic,  
${name}`
  ],

  account_manager: [
    `Dear ${company},

Client whisperer. Chaos translator. Deadline juggler. That‚Äôs my LinkedIn bio. But what I really am? A bridge between ambition and execution.

I‚Äôve turned vague client feedback into actionable gold. I‚Äôve herded creative cats across four time zones.

Forever following up,  
${name}`
  ],

  social_media: [
    `Dear ${company},

I live in the comments section. I breathe in memes, exhale engagement.

From reactive TikToks to carefully timed thirst traps, I craft content that not only converts ‚Äî it *goes viral*.

Hire me and your brand won‚Äôt just be present online ‚Äî it‚Äôll be the main character.

#HireMeMaybe  
${name}`

  art_director: [
    `Dear ${company},

I don‚Äôt just make things look good ‚Äî I make them iconic.

I've moodboarded my way out of disasters, color-corrected broken dreams, and led teams through the great Helvetica Wars of 2022.

Let‚Äôs build the next visual legacy.

With style (and substance),  
${name}`
  ],

  media_planner: [
    `Hello ${company},

While others see CPMs and GRPs, I see poetry in placement.

I‚Äôve outbid giants, outsmarted algorithms, and delivered ROI with the grace of a budget-savvy ballerina.

Optimistically yours,  
${name}`
  ],

  hr: [
    `Dear ${company},

HR isn‚Äôt about policies. It‚Äôs about people ‚Äî and I‚Äôm in the business of building cults (the healthy kind).

From onboarding to offboarding, I make sure employees feel seen, heard, and slightly too comfortable.

Let‚Äôs build a workplace they‚Äôll cry about on LinkedIn ‚Äî in a good way.

Warmly,  
${name}`
  ],

  finance: [
    `Dear ${company},

Spreadsheets are my love language.

I‚Äôve balanced budgets tighter than your jeans after year-end bonuses. I bring logic, structure, and just enough sass to make accounting a core brand function.

Let me bring balance to your books ‚Äî and your soul.

Sincerely,  
${name}`

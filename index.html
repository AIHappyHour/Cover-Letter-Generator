        `Dear [COMPANY],

Words. They're not just my tools â€” they're my battleground.

Whether it's a three-word headline or a manifesto that makes planners cry, I bring emotion, edge, and just the right amount of alliteration.

Hire me, and let's turn your brand story into an epic worth binge-reading.

Yours in Oxford commas,  
[NAME]`,
        `Dear [COMPANY],

Words are my medium. Chaos is my process. And deadlines? Just adrenaline with a timestamp.

If you're looking for someone who can write snappy, soulful, and occasionally viral â€” I'm ready to ruin a Google Doc near you.

Copy that,  
[NAME]`,

`To the heroic humans at [COMPANY],

I've written manifestos, microcopy, and one absolutely cursed billboard line I will not discuss.

If you want someone who understands tone, timing, and trauma bonding with art directors â€” I'm your pen for hire.

Sincerely,  
[NAME]`,

`Hi [COMPANY],

Copywriting is 10% writing and 90% rewriting. I do both with equal passion and panic.

Let's make the kind of work that clients sign off on *and* people screenshot.

Wordily yours,  
[NAME]`,

`Dear [COMPANY],

You need a line that sells. I write ones that *sing*. (And also meet compliance requirements.)

From pitch decks to punchlines, I bring big energy to every brief â€” even the weird ones.

Respectfully chaotic,  
[NAME]`,

`To [COMPANY],

Every brand needs a voice. I'll give you one that whispers, shouts, seduces, and occasionally shitposts â€” all in one tone guide.

Let's build something worth plagiarizing.

Loud and clear,  
[NAME]`,

`Hello [COMPANY],

I've crafted CTAs with more charm than my dating profile and slogans that nearly won awards (and definitely won internal battles).

Ready to word-wrangle your next big idea into existence.

Copywritten with love,  
[NAME]`

      strategist: [
        `To the fine minds at [COMPANY],

Ever since I first uttered the words "consumer insight," I knew I was born for this.

If you're looking for someone who can connect cultural trends to campaign KPIs faster than a Gen Z on TikTok, I'm your person.

Let's architect the strategy that Cannes case studies are made of.

Always aligning,  
[NAME]`,
        
        `To the brilliant minds at [COMPANY],

I speak fluent insight. I translate data into drama. I connect dots others don't even see.

If you want strategy with teeth â€” not just slides â€” I'm your person.

Strategically chaotic,  
[NAME]`,

`Dear [COMPANY],

Every good idea starts with a why. I dig until we find it, then dig past it.

If you're looking for someone who makes trends make sense, let's talk.

With aligned intent,  
[NAME]`,

`Hi [COMPANY],

I've researched gen Z more than gen Z has researched itself. I've got hot takes, sharp decks, and a serious grudge against vague briefs.

Let's find the story behind the story.

Brain-first,  
[NAME]`,

`To [COMPANY],

I don't do "consumers." I do humans â€” beautifully irrational and endlessly fascinating.

Let's crack some insight. Or at least the group chat.

      designer: [
        `Hey [COMPANY],

Design isn't decoration. It's storytelling with pixels, gridlines, and just enough white space to breathe.

From brutalist banners to brand guidelines tighter than kerning on a Helvetica R, I build with feeling and finesse.

Aesthetic allegiance,  
[NAME]`,
        
        `Dear [COMPANY],

I've finessed Figma files at 3am and rebuilt brand systems with two sliders and a prayer.

Design is how I communicate â€” especially when the brief doesn't.

Pleasing grids and gods,  
[NAME]`,

`Hello [COMPANY],

My files are clean, my layers are named, and my ideas are dirtier than Helvetica in neon.

Let's make beautiful things that punch people in the face â€” visually, of course.

Designfully yours,  
[NAME]`,

`To [COMPANY],

Design isn't what it looks like. It's what it makes people feel. Mostly awe. Occasionally jealousy.

Hire me and let's vibe-check your visual system.

Signed with symmetry,  
[NAME]`,

`Dear [COMPANY],

From pitch decks to pitch-perfect key visuals, I've done it all â€” and made it look good.

Let's redesign everything. Or at least the industry standard.

Colorfully,

      creative_director: [
        `Dear [COMPANY],

I don't direct creatives. I conduct symphonies of chaos into campaigns that convert.

Give me your briefs, your budgets, your jaded clients yearning to believe again â€” and I'll give you the best work of their fiscal year.

In relentless pursuit of big ideas,  
[NAME]`,

        `To the team at [COMPANY],

I've turned brainstorms into battles, post-its into poetry, and edits into Emmy bait.

If your agency wants iconic, not just effective â€” I'm ready to make award season cry.

Humbly legendary,  
[NAME]`,

        `Dear [COMPANY],

Every campaign starts with a whisper. I turn that whisper into a roar.

From Cannes to client decks, I speak fluent chaos and vision. Let me help your agency forget what safe ever looked like.

Signed with ambition,  
[NAME]`,

        `Hello [COMPANY],

Vision. Volume. Vibes. That's what I bring to a pitch, a room, and a Slack thread.

I've led global teams with three hours of sleep and one killer idea. Let's create the kind of work the industry worships and interns quote in pitch decks.

Loudly leading,  
[NAME]`,

        `Dear [COMPANY],

You don't just need a creative director. You need a dream disruptor with pitch decks that make clients weep (with joy).

Let's take your agency's name from memorableâ€¦ to mythological.

Respectfully iconic,  
[NAME]`,
        
        `Dear [COMPANY],

I don't just lead creative â€” I direct existential crises into Cannes submissions. I build brands from chaos and pitch decks from fumes.

Let's turn your brainstorms into case studies. Or at least into something shiny on LinkedIn.

Madly yours,  
[NAME]`,

`Hello [COMPANY],

If your agency wants work that "pushes boundaries" but actually means it this time, I'm ready to enter the group chat.

I bring vision, velocity, and just enough delusion to make magic happen.

Big ideas only,  
[NAME]`,

`Dear [COMPANY],

I'm what happens when ambition meets caffeine and a team of wildly talented weirdos.

I've led agencies, survived pitches, and once made a CMO cry (in a good way). Ready when you are.

Powerfully yours,  
[NAME]`,

`Hi [COMPANY],

The briefs are never clear. The deadlines are always yesterday. And yet? The work sings.

Let me bring a little unhinged brilliance to your next campaign.

Leading loudly,

      account_manager: [
        `Dear [COMPANY],

Client whisperer. Chaos translator. Deadline juggler. That's my LinkedIn bio. But what I really am? A bridge between ambition and execution.

I've turned vague client feedback into actionable gold. I've herded creative cats across four time zones.

Forever following up,  
[NAME]`,
        
        `Dear [COMPANY],

I'm a people person â€” even when the people are clients with 47 feedback points.

I manage expectations, egos, and inboxes â€” all with a smile and one well-timed meme.

Best,  
[NAME]`,

`To the legends at [COMPANY],

Account management is more than timelines and timesheets. It's knowing when to push back, and when to bring muffins.

Let's get this campaign (and relationship) off the ground.

Yours in follow-ups,  
[NAME]`,

`Hello [COMPANY],

I've translated client chaos into creative clarity more times than I can count.

If you want someone who can charm, chase, and champion your work â€” that's me.

Consider it done,  
[NAME]`,

`Dear [COMPANY],

I'm the calm in the client storm. The "I'll handle it" in a sea of CCs. The deadline whisperer.

Let me be your chaos coordinator.

Sincerely,  
[NAME]`

      social_media: [
        `Dear [COMPANY],

I live in the comments section. I breathe in memes, exhale engagement.

From reactive TikToks to carefully timed thirst traps, I craft content that not only converts â€” it *goes viral*.

Hire me and your brand won't just be present online â€” it'll be the main character.

#HireMeMaybe  
[NAME]`,
        
        `Hi [COMPANY],

I've tweeted through crisis, TikTok'd through budget cuts, and built engagement with nothing but bad puns and good instincts.

Let's break the algorithm together.

#BookedAndBusy,  
[NAME]`,

`Dear [COMPANY],

I don't just make content. I make conversations, chaos, and occasionally culture.

Hire me, and your brand won't just exist online â€” it'll run the group chat.

Socially charged,  
[NAME]`,

`To the digital minds at [COMPANY],

From carousels to comments, I turn scrolls into stans.

Let's make content so good they'll think it was real-time.

Double-tapping this opportunity,  
[NAME]`,

`Dear [COMPANY],

I've grown communities, managed mentions, and survived eight "urgent" trends before breakfast.

      art_director: [
        `Dear [COMPANY],

I don't just make things look good â€” I make them iconic.

I've moodboarded my way out of disasters, color-corrected broken dreams, and led teams through the great Helvetica Wars of 2022.

Let's build the next visual legacy.

With style (and substance),  
[NAME]`,
        
`Dear [COMPANY],

I've art directed shoots, socials, and one very high-maintenance creative director.

My taste is sharp, my eye is sharper, and my moodboards are borderline prophetic.

Optimistically yours,  
[NAME]`,

I don't just buy media. I orchestrate audience epiphanies.

From budget splits to brand lifts, I make sure every penny works harder than an intern.

ROI-fully yours,

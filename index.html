Dear ${company},

Words. They‚Äôre not just my tools ‚Äî they‚Äôre my battleground.

Whether it‚Äôs a three-word headline or a manifesto that makes planners cry, I bring emotion, edge, and just the right amount of alliteration.

I‚Äôve written ads that made people laugh, cry, and occasionally buy things. I believe in big ideas, bigger ambition, and snackable content that slaps.

Hire me, and let‚Äôs turn your brand story into an epic worth binge-reading.

Yours in Oxford commas,
${name}
        `,
        strategist: `
To the fine minds at ${company},

Ever since I first uttered the words ‚Äúconsumer insight,‚Äù I knew I was born for this.

I don't just think outside the box ‚Äî I audit the box, segment its audience, and deliver a deck that turns boxes into business objectives.

If you're looking for someone who can connect cultural trends to campaign KPIs faster than a Gen Z on TikTok, I'm your person.

Let's architect the strategy that Cannes case studies are made of.

Always aligning,
${name}
        `,
        designer: `
Hey ${company},

Design isn't decoration. It‚Äôs storytelling with pixels, gridlines, and just enough white space to breathe.

From brutalist banners to brand guidelines tighter than kerning on a Helvetica R, I build with feeling and finesse.

If your brand needs a visual renaissance, I‚Äôm ready to make the magic.

Aesthetic allegiance,
${name}
        `,
        creative_director: `
Dear ${company},

I don't direct creatives. I conduct symphonies of chaos into campaigns that convert.

I‚Äôve led brainstorms that turned Post-Its into pitch wins, and mentored teams like a Buddhist monk with a Behance portfolio.

Give me your briefs, your budgets, your jaded clients yearning to believe again ‚Äî and I‚Äôll give you the best work of their fiscal year.

In relentless pursuit of big ideas,
${name}
        `,
        account_manager: `
Dear ${company},

Client whisperer. Chaos translator. Deadline juggler. That‚Äôs my LinkedIn bio. But what I really am? A bridge between ambition and execution.

I‚Äôve turned vague client feedback into actionable gold. I‚Äôve herded creative cats across four time zones. I‚Äôve smiled through 7am status calls.

Let me be the glue that holds your dream team (and your timelines) together.

Forever following up,
